# Nifty-50-Momentum-Sentiment-Return-Forecast
Built a pipeline that combines 3 years of Nifty-50 price data, multi-horizon momentum indicators, and real-time FinBERT news sentiment into a daily composite ranking, with one-click Prophet forecasts for 30/180/365-day horizons.

Leveraged three years of historical price data for all 50 Nifty constituents, computed multi-horizon momentum indicators, extracted real-time news sentiment with FinBERT, and combined them into a daily composite ranking. Then I used Facebook Prophet to forecast 30-, 180-, and 365-day price trajectories for any stock with one click.
